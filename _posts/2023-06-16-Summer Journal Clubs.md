<p>Looking for something to do this summer? Interested in Bioinformatics or Machine Learning? I may have just the thing for you!
Myself and my mentee group (FishStalkers) are proud to announce are our twice weekly remote journal clubs in Bioinformatics and Machine Learning summer journal clubs. We all had a blast teaching the [Georgia Tech Research] (https://www.linkedin.com/company/research-at-georgia-tech/) community at our Mathematics and Computer Science Symposium this spring and we want to keep those conversations going in our newest educational outreach program!</p>
<p>These groups will be lead by myself and [Veena Gonugondla] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/veena-gonugondla/) a fantastic computer science student and Women, Science, and Technology fellow who is passionate about making machine learning and bioinformatics topics accessible to all researchers and learners.</p>
<p>This opportunity is open to everyone in the Georgia Tech communityðŸ˜Š
<p>Looking forward to seeing you there!!</p>
