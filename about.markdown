    <li>Creating and improving classifiers which will predict cichlid fish behavior in video data
        <ul>
            <li>Review literature to find behaviors of biological importance and learn to identify complex behaviors in video which aids in correctly training our machine learning model</li>
            <li>Learn and utilize computer vision classifier. Seek and develop new tools that will improve accuracy on cichlid behavior</li>
            <li>Understand classification algorithms and provide a comparative analysis of why one algorithm performs better than another for our application</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Using unsupervised clustering techniques to extract biologically significant expression of behavior using neuronal data
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the significance of neuronal cell types, genes, and traditional methods for studying gene expression</li>
            <li>Complete a robust comparative study of clustering techniques and work with biologists to determine the method with highest biological insight </li>
